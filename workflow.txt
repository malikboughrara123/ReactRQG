this is the workflow of how i proceeded of creating my random quote generator react app

Approach to the Project : 
let's take the project step by step.
A bit of thinking about what to do prior to having the fingers hit the keyboard
goes a long way! Some things that come to mind this early: 

1/- Make a decision on the quotes data structure (array of objects(2 properties: quotes and authors))
2/- inspect 
3/-
---------------------------------------
in react there's two types of componenets: 
- container componenets ====> usually hold the state and all the data 
and they pass down that data into the presentational componenets
- presentational components (generic button component) where i can pass props
as new quote 

---------------------------------------
this specific project will have an app components which will hold
the entire state(current quote), and that current quote will have the current 
author

1/- implement the functionality 
2/- styling the components 

---------------------------------------
1/- import quote data into our component 
    - Quote data should be an object with 2 properties : author and text

2/- randomly shoose a quote on button click
3/- Display quote and author

{
    Data (in state) 
        SELECTED_QUOTE
        * Quote data   
        * Selected quote index 
    Methods 
        * selectNewRandomIndex
}


4/- lodash library is used for returning a random number from 0
to whatever number i choose (lower and upper)

INITIALIZATION :

on component mount ('useEffect'), 'getQuotes()' fetches quotes 
and initializes "quotes" and "selectedQuoteIndex"

BUTTON CLICK : 

clicking "next quote" updates "selectedQuoteIndex" to display a new quote


RENDERING : 

quotes are displayed conditionally based on "selectedQuoteIndex"
ensuring robust handling of state and asynchronous data fetching
